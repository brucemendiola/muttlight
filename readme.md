Muttlight
=========

Muttlight is a MacOS application that improves search and preview for email 
files stored in [MailDir](http://cr.yp.to/proto/maildir.html) format.
Specifically, it allows the associated file extensions to be specified and 
registered via a graphical user interface, provides a Spotlight importer to 
extract meta data, and integrates with Quick Look to provide previews and 
thumbnails.
